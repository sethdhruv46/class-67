A long time ago, there lived a thirsty crow in a dense forest.On a hot summer day,the bird felt very thirsty and started to search fo water nearby after a mile or two he found a container half filled with water but his beak couldn't reach down to the water . he again and again tried of drinking water but couldn't. He started losing hope and then an idea struck his mind and he started collecting and throwing pebbles in it. After sometime the level increased and he could quench his beak in the pot and drank water finally at last.
